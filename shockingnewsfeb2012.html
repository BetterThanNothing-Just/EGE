<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">(Email to friends of Eddi -<wbr> sent Feb 2012)</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">Dear Friend</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">You are receiving this because a) you are already a friend of Eddi Piper or b) you
    might like to help her because you are a friend of mine and I think she deserves
    some help.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">Eddi left Brighton last year to run a charity project helping victims of the tsunami
    in Sri Lanka. Most of the dead were women, and now many boys and men have no female
    relations left. There are also many orphans and much poverty and on top of all that
    Sri Lanka has just come through a civil war. The people are coping with some really
    awful circumstances and trying to rebuild their lives. Too many take their own lives
    through loneliness and despair. Eddi runs a community centre which helps people in
    many practical ways and gives them some hope. </span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">I had an email from her recently which ended like this:</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am not looking forward to the seemingly inevitable time maybe in October when
    I have to stop most of the &nbsp;classes as there is just not enough funding to continue
    without me supplementing it myself, and I can&#39;t really afford to continue with that
    any longer. &nbsp;At the moment if I close for a month in April we should be OK until
    June. &nbsp;I keep telling myself that &quot;the money will come from wherever the money is
    now! &quot;as a Buddhist wise man said.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I could cancel all current classes and, using the monthly regular donations,
    just do half a day a week with some orphanage children based in Dodanduwa. That would
    be a very good thing to do as these kids , though well looked after, don&#39;t get much
    time out of the orphanage. Yusemi, a 5 year old with cerebral palsy, is coming on
    fine and will get her wheel chair next week !! thanks to Prasad our music teacher
    who is himself in a wheelchair and has somehow or other raised the funds to buy it
    for her. &quot; </span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">In short Eddi will have to chose between keeping the centre open and giving a few
    treats to orphans because she cannot afford to do both and cannot continue to subsidise
    the centre from her small pension.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C5">The Shocking News: </span><span class="Body-C-C3">It costs just &#163;300 a month to run the centre.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">I am sure we all think that we would/should/could do something equally admirable,
    but we don&#39;t because [insert your excuse here]. Eddi is doing it for us. All her
    friends have to do is help her with a paltry few pounds every month so she can get
    on with it. &nbsp;This is a very personal project. All the money for the project comes
    from individuals who know Eddi, people who sing with Eddi and people who Eddi has
    helped. There is no funding from outside her circle of friends. Last year Eddi emailed
    her mail list asking people to set up a monthly standing order for &#163;5. A dozen responded
    and currently send a total of &#163;65 a month. It would be really sad if Eddi&#39;s friends
    could not scrape together &#163;300 a month.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">I am sure that some of you who received that original email meant to respond but
    simply did not get around to it -<wbr> if so please do it now. If this is the first time
    you have been asked, please set up a monthly standing order now. Most of us will
    not even notice &#163;5 or &#163;10 a month. If you just cannot afford it, that is fine, this
    is not about making anyone feel</span></p>

<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">guilty. If you can spare a few quid, setting up a standing order is easy (see below)</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">Please consider passing this email on to some carefully selected personal friends,
    people who you think will recognise the value of what Eddi is doing and trust your
    judgement when you say it is a really worthwhile cause. How many charities can you
    say this about:</span></p>

<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3"><br></span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">If you have not yet set up a standing order please do it now. (see below for details)</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">For those who have a standing order for a fiver you will know by now that you don&#39;t
    even notice it going out each moth, consider increasing it to &#163;10.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">By giving a few quid you free up Eddi&#39;s time to help people who had little to start

<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">PS This email is sent &#39;BCC&#39; (the recipients names are hidden) so you are likely to
    receive multiple copies of this &quot;Shocking News from Sri Lanka&quot; email because a lot

    to help. Please be patient and delete duplicates.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C5">Background:</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">Eddi is in Sri Lanka on a project to reduce the suicide rate among the survivors
    of the 2004 Tsunami. It is a very real problem for people who have lost family, friends,
    homes and livelihoods. She does not stress the suicide aspect of the project directly
    for reasons of diplomacy, respect and sensitivity -<wbr> but that is the underlying reason
    for her being there. They do things differently there. It is not feasible to put
    a poster up saying &#39;Feeling Suicidal? -<wbr> Call Us&#39; as the Samaritans might do in the
    UK.</span></p>
<p class="Wp-Body-P"><span class="Body-C-C3">She interacts with the community by running a community centre which teaches skills
    to (mainly) young women which will allow them to earn a living in either business
    or tourism. This is a worthwhile enterprise in itself and gives the young women some
    independence and helps build their self-<wbr>esteem. It also gives Eddi a route into the
    wider community. All of this contributes to the core aim of the project. </span></p>
